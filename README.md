# Guinea Greens

This is a work in progress for a mobile application that grants user a simple and accessible way to track their guinea pig's diet and learn more about their pet's needs in terms of diet, hygiene, and more. 

Features to be added: 
•	Search any fruit or vegetable to see if it is safe for guinea pigs and what the recommended quantity is.
•	Schedule and track daily feeding times and portions along with the guinea pig's weight.
•	Guinea pig’s diet requirements/information, such as how much vitamin C and fresh greens are needed.
•	Other Guinea pig fun facts and interactive implementations to make learning fun, such as using icons or animations.
•	Cute pictures or icons of guinea pigs to create a user-friendly, pretty application.

Benefits of the application:
•	Educates owners on the nutritional needs of guinea pigs, which encourages more attentive care and responsibility, especially if the owner is a first-time guinea pig owner.
•	Ensures guinea pigs receive a proper diet, which prevents health problems, such as scurvy, since they are sensitive creatures who lack some basic bodily functions.
•	Convenience for owners to easily access information, organize their schedule, and receive reminders for feeding times along with alerts when food supplies are low.
•	Could inspire others to take better care of pets in general and spread awareness about the importance of fulfilling pets’ diet needs.
•	Can potentially be further developed into an app that includes a variety of different animals.
